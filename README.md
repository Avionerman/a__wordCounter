# a__wordCounter
Scope of this project is to count words from a vast amount of '.txt' files.


I personally wrote a script which can receive a directory (a path) and then its job is to read and count the words.
Except from the counting of the words another vital aspect was to find the word with the most appearences in each file, to find the Median and lastly the words which are having a sum bigger than the median of the file.
